Alita is an orange cat, well actually still a kitten. She's enjoying the
company of her new pal, another grey cat -- Loki.

Alita and Loki have been spending a lot of time together playing with balls of
yarn, meowing at one another and whatever else it is that cats do. Sadly, this
morning Brutus - their third housemate and biggest nemisis - got his stinky
paws on ALita and Loki's favorite ball of yarn. Alita and Loki are not having
it. They want their ball of yarn back.
