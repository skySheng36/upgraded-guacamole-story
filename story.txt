Alita is an orange cat, well actually still a kitten. She's enjoying the
company of her new pal, another grey cat -- Loki.

Alita and Loki have been spending a lot of time together playing with balls of
yarn, meowing at one another and whatever else it is that cats do. Sadly, this
morning Brutus - their third housemate and biggest nemisis - got his stinky
paws on ALita and Loki's favorite ball of yarn. Alita and Loki are not having
it. They want their ball of yarn back.

With this said Alita and Loki are preparing for war. They are sharpening their claws
and getting ready for battle. Meanwhile Brutus is laying on the floor with the stolen
ball of yarn without a care in the world. Rolling around on the ground with no worries
not expecting what is yet to come. Alita and Loki are inching forward towards Brutus
ready to take back their rightful ball of yarn that was handed to them and not Brutus.
