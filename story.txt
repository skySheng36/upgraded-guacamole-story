Alita is an orange cat, well actually still a kitten. She's enjoying the
company of her new pal, another grey cat -- Loki.

Alita and Loki have been spending a lot of time together playing with balls of
yarn, meowing at one another and whatever else it is that cats do. Sadly, this
morning Brutus - their third housemate and biggest nemisis - got his stinky
paws on ALita and Loki's favorite ball of yarn. Alita and Loki are not having
it. They want their ball of yarn back.

With this said Alita and Loki are preparing for war. They are sharpening their claws
and getting ready for battle. Meanwhile Brutus is laying on the floor with the stolen
ball of yarn without a care in the world. Rolling around on the ground with no worries
not expecting what is yet to come. Alita and Loki are inching forward towards Brutus
ready to take back their rightful ball of yarn that was handed to them and not Brutus. 
Alita and Loki really loves the idea of sharing their ball of yarn with friends. `

Apparently under some collective bipolar mood swing, the two cats approach Brutus with
playful intent. Brutus being the dumb oaf he is finds nothing wrong with his. His two
best friends in the world who definitely don't hate him and don't think he's smelly
have come to play. Cue cute playful cat montage. As the trio tire out, Alita and Loki
come to their senses and remember their initial reason for coming here in the first place.
They angrily snatch their ball of yarn--now as stinky as Brutus himself--back triumphantly
and strut away. All's well that end's well in the temperamental world of cats.
